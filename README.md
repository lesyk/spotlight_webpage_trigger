#Installation

    git clone https://github.com/lesyk/spotlight_webpage_triggers.git
    cp -r spotlight_webpage_triggers/triggers/ ~/Library/Caches/Metadata/Safari/triggers/
    rm -rf spotlight_webpage_triggers

#Description
By default Spotlight builds index of <i>Bookmarks & History</i>, which is stored in ~/Library/Caches/Metadata/Safari/. I made a list of <i>my favourite websites</i> and moved it to the searchable folder.

Notation of double exclamation marks (stolen from [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com)) gives higher probability to find needed *.webarchive.

###Why?
There are some tools (like, [Flashlight](https://github.com/nate-parrott/Flashlight), and [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com)), which can do quite a lot with Spotlight, however, [Flashlight](https://github.com/nate-parrott/Flashlight) is not working in El Capitan 10.11, and [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com) is not free. Also, I need only this precise functionality.
